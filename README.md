📊 #Heart Disease Data Analysis Project | Python + Power BI

I recently completed an end-to-end EDA project on the **Heart Disease Prediction dataset (Kaggle)** where I followed a proper data analytics workflow:

#🔹 Data Cleaning in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

* Renamed columns for readability
  
* Fixed data types

* Dropped unnecessary columns

* Converted Heart Disease into numerical (0/1) for better analysis

#🔹 Analysis & Visualization in Power BI (using DAX)

I built an interactive dashboard and explored relationships between medical and demographic factors.

#📌 Key Insights:

* Heart disease cases are **higher in males** compared to females.

* Certain chest pain types are strongly associated with heart disease.

* Max heart rate decreases with age, especially in patients with heart disease.

* Average cholesterol tends to increase with age, showing higher risk in older groups.

* Patients with **fasting blood sugar > 120 show higher heart disease occurrence.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
✅ Data Cleaning
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ DAX Measures
✅ Healthcare Data Interpretation

I’d love feedback from the data community!
